**Mental Health Predictor**

Mental Health Predictor is a machine learning–based web application that predicts potential mental health risks such as stress, anxiety, and depression based on user responses.

🔍 Problem Statement
Mental health issues often go unnoticed due to lack of early assessment tools. This project aims to provide a simple, data-driven way to identify potential mental health concerns.

🧠 Approach
- Collected and preprocessed mental health survey data
- Trained machine learning classification models
- Evaluated model performance using accuracy metrics
- Deployed the trained model using Flask for real-time predictions

🛠 Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Flask
- HTML, CSS

📊 Outcome
- Successfully built an end-to-end ML pipeline
- Enabled real-time predictions through a web interface

🚀 Future Improvements
- Improve model accuracy with more data
- Add user authentication
- Deploy on cloud platform (AWS / Render)

📌 Note
This project is built for learning and academic purposes.
